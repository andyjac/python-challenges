alphabet problem:

1. loop through users text
2. for each character in their text, check whether or not the character is a letter or a symbol (i.e. a form of puncuation or a space)
3. if it is a symbol, simply add the character to a list as is
4. if the character is a letter, find that same letter in a list containing the entire sequential alphabet
5. once the character has been found in the alphabet, move forward two letters and return that character (i.e. the letter "a" should return the letter "c")
6. take the returned letter and add it to the list with the other translated letters and symbols

pseudo-code:

theText = 'rfgq gq kv rcur.'
theList = []
theAlphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxyz'

translate(theText)
    for each character in theText

        if the character is not a letter

            add it to theList

        however if the character is a letter

            find the letter in theAlphabet
            advance forward two characters in theAlphabet
            add the letter found there to theList

    join theList characters together into a single string
    return that string

translate(theText) ==> should return: "this is my text."
